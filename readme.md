# Simple WP Docker Setup

This is a very basic setup using Docker and WordPress. It uses the official WordPress image and the Docker Community MariaDB image.

To get set up, make sure you have `docker-compose` set up. See [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for instructions.

Once `docker-compose` is installed and set up, run `docker-compose up -d` and visit [127.0.0.1:8080](127.0.0.1:8080)

To shutdown, run `docker-compose stop`
